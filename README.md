Welcome to my FYP project. 
This is the DIY Home Monitoring System that seamlessly distributes the workload of staff at PKOTC (Persatuan Kebajikan Orang Tua Ceria). The system had implemented the function of camera streaming, making a call, and digital data entry. 

Please refer to the code in Arduino and Node.js for Websocket Connection of ESP 32 Camera module.
